I will be working with airbnb dataset to perform various transformations in KNIME software. Missing values for features(security_deposit & cleaning_fee) were imputed in RStudio using Multiple Imputation by Classification and Regression Trees in RStudio (CART). Simple linear regression was performed and feature importance done with Boruta package in RStudio.
